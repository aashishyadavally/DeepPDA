# Joern Output Analysis

In this directory, we present the Joern outputs for 66 StackOverflow code snippets from Section IX.

The directory structure is as follows:
- `/snippets` : Contains sub-directories `snippet-x`, each containing the files `code.txt`, `dependencies.json`, and `joern.out`. In cases where Joern generated an error for the code snippet, we attach the `error.txt` file.
- `/joern` : Contains Joern package to replicate Joern outputs. Please refer to file `usage.py`.
- `Joern-Output-Analysis.xlsx` - Spreadsheet containing detailed analysis for all 66 code snippets.
